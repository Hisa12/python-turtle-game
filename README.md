Space Turtle Chomp is a fun, time-limited game where you control a turtle to collect food while competing against an AI turtle. The goal is to collect as much food as possible before time runs out!

## Features
* Player vs. AI: You control a turtle, and an AI controls another turtle.
* Food Collection: Collect food to score points.
* Time Limit: The game lasts 60 seconds.
* Scoreboard: Tracks the score for both the player and the AI.

## Controls
* Left Arrow: Turn your turtle left.
* Right Arrow: Turn your turtle right.
* Up Arrow: Increase your turtle's speed.

## How to Play
1. Start the Game: The game begins with both you and the AI moving on the screen.
2. Collect Food: Both turtles try to eat food scattered across the screen. Each food item you collect adds to your score.
3. Avoid Boundaries: Don't let your turtle hit the edges of the screen!
4. Game Over: The game ends after 60 seconds. The turtle with the most food collected wins!
